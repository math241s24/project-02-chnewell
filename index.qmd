## Abstract

I want to make a visualization of quantity and correlation through an interactive search method for the MTG rulings.

## Introduction

The MTG rulebook is about 250 pages. Understanding the rules completely is hard enough as it is. The goal of this project is to make a tool that will display trends and patterns in the rules, to better understand what mechanics in the rules are correlated.
